### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (One lesson we learned is switch statements.Switch cases involve cases and a default setting. You can also add “toUpperCase()” or “toLowerCase()” to change the case off what was entered. Switch statements have more flexibility than else/if statements.  )
2. (Another lesson we learned is that an array is a set of data represented by a single variable name. Also, an array is made up of elements.)
3. (We learned about loop statements which repeat code. Three types of loop statements are while, do/while, and for.)
